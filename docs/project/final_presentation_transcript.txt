Hello, my name is Chris Bracken, and I'm excited to present my project for DTSA 5506
Data Mining Project
Today, I'll be discussing field chart OCR, which is a system to design extract, designed to extract and digitize hand-written charts and tables
This presentation will have--
Provide a clear overview of the project motivation
technical approach and evaluation plans for supervisory level stakeholders
Let me begin with an overview of the project
Digitizing handwriting charts presents significant challenges due to varied handwriting styles, inconsistent layouts, and noise in scanned images Manual transcription is slow in time consuming, creating substantial pain points for data accessibility and analysis
Field chart OCR aims to automate this process by improving accuracy and efficiency, converting handwritten visual data
into machinery
for us
The key challenges in digitization of hand-written charts are multifested
Handrating is...
inconsistent, highly inconsistent
across individuals
Third
The second we encounter diverse charts
Then chart layouts and formats and third
Image noise from camera captures or scans introduces additional complexities
These factors lead to difficulties in automated recognition
Station
the lack of standardization
The lack of standardization required increases error rates and makes manual transcription both time consuming
and costly
Addressing these challenges requires robust processing
robust pre-posting process
robust pre-processing classification, and it was here techniques specifically tailored to 100 data
Originally I had planned to tackle a wide variety of handwritten notes I envisioned digitizing time sheets, tables with mixed flow, and integer values, checklists, freeform writing online paper, and even student worksheets for grading purposes
However,
The project proves substantially more difficult than I had initially imagined As a result, I made the strategic decision to limit the digitization efforts to bar shirts
Specifically this book
and specifically
Marchered specifically
This focused approach allowed me to build out an entire end and pipeline and understand what the complete
Get in work though, what do you look like?
The brush rates represent an excellent starting point for several reasons First, the colors are--
which simplifies detection. Second, the axes follow predictable straight lines, making geometric analysis
more straightforward, there's minimal character recognition where to extract
for data
Finally
Bar shirts have a very predictable and structured form
which makes them more amenable to
automated processing
compared to freeform writing
Here you can see, uh,
- Yeah
Here you can see the three images
Here you can see three images demonstrating the current state
of the preprocessing
You can see three images demonstrating the currency of preprocessing
The first image on the left shows the crop
Best image
The first image
This represents the pre-processing stage where I was able to detect the edges of the paper and normalize it for further processing
The center image shows the page area with different features
Highlighting. Highlighting
with different features highlighted
Center
the green boxing compasses
Technical approach employs a modular architecture combining pre-processing classification and section models
preprocessing is crucial because when taking pictures of pages they're not always oriented consistent
text direction varies, paper consistency differs
and pre-processing stage includes
photo normalization, which standardizes the image inputs, classification identifies the chart type, in this case distinguishing birth shirts from other chart types
Detection bottles and then
Detection models and extracts the specific elements
This module, our approach allows fertility detection models for different chart types
rather than trying to handle all charts styles with the single extraction method
Eventually, the system will integrate OCR for hand rid text recognition
We should hand off
to element recognition functions and information extraction functions to reconstruct charts and tables accurately The goal is to automate the extraction pipeline, significantly reducing manual effort while maintaining high accuracy for indigitizing complex handwritten visual data
Successful, we measured using several key metrics Classification performance will be evaluated using F1 scores
to detection accuracy when measured, how well measured, how well the system identifies [BLANK_AUDIO]
Character error rate will assess your performance
However,
And finally, runtime performance will determine how well your workflow can manage high volumes of data
These metrics will guide iterative
It's iterative
and permit permits and
ensure the system means practical usability and reliability standards
the input files were
Check one, two, one, two, check, check, one, two, one, two, check

Hello, my name is Chris Brecken, and I'm excited to present my project for DTSA 555-06, the data mining project Today I'll be discussing Field Chart OCR
which is a system designed to extract
and digitize handwritten charts and tables
This presentation will provide a clear overview of the project more
technical approach
Evaluation Plans
And
timelines for supervisory level stakeholders
Let me begin with an overview of the project
digitizing handwritten charts presents
significant challenge due to varied handwriting styles
inconsistent videos
and noise and scanned images
manual transcription is slow and time consuming
creating substantial pain points for data accessibility
and analysis
Field chart OCR aims to automate this process by improving accuracy and efficiency
and bring handwritten visual data into machine readers
The key challenges in digitizing handwritten charts are multifested
First handwriting is highly inconsistent
individuals. Second, we encounter diverse chart formats and layouts. Third, image noise from camera captures where scans introduces additional complexity
These factors lead to difficulties in automated recognition
in interpretation
The lack of standardization increases error rates and makes manual transcription both time consuming and costly
Addressing these challenges requires
of us preprocessing
classification and OCR techniques specifically tailored for handwritten data
Originally, I had planned to tackle a wide variety
and written notes. I envisioned
Digitizing time sheets
tables with mixed float and integer values, checklists, free form writing online paper, and even student worksheets for grading purposes
The process...
However, excuse me, however the project proves substantially more difficult than I had initially
As a result, I made this strategic decision to
digitization efforts to bar church specifically this focused
approach allowed me to build out an entire end-to-end pipeline
and understand what the complete data works or what it looks like
Bar shirts represent an excellent starting point for several reasons First
The colors used in brown shirts are easily indistinguishable
which simplifies detection
Second, the axes follow predictable straight lines
Making geometric analysis more straightforward
Third, there's him
>> I'm a little character recognition
prior to extract the core data Finally
Marchets have a very predictable instruction form, which makes them more amenable to animated processes
compared to free form writing
This image shows the page area with the different features
How edit in the green?
But you can see the bar chart area, while the red features are reused for corner detection and the blue features for port page orientation
That one
Here you can see three images demonstrating the current state of the...
processing pipeline
The first image on the left
It shows the cropped and normalized image This is the final
project product
Final stage
I was able to get to
I was able to detect the edges of the paper and normalize it
for the processing
The image on the right shows manual measurements
of it
camera picture that I'd taken, and that were used to validate the sizing, cropping, and rotation
and scaling to make sure that also that scaling was consistent
with actual paper dimensions
And uh...
image in the middle
features
And overlay
Now, digital
paper on top of a camera picture showing how I wanted to orient it
and what features I was probably
Back forward
There were a number of--
works that I read in order to accomplish this
and the project builds on several important papers in the field First
ChartOSER data extraction for chart images via a deep hybrid framework combines deep learning and rule-based methods for extracting data from computer-generated reports
Automation, classification analysis, and redesign of chart images addresses extracting data from computer reports for data during a realization of poorly designed charts
Chartsense, interactive data interaction
Extraction from chart images combines human in the loop methods
Towards automated evaluation of handwritten assessments, deal specifically with the OCR for grading handwritten assessments, which is directly relevant to my work
from pixels to inside
on automatic chart understanding in the era of large
That paper provides a comprehensive survey of chair comprehension methods using foundational models Finally, improving handwritten mathematical expressions which I found particularly interesting
Excuse me
Improving handwritten mathematical expression recognition by integrating network with transformer and diffusion-based auto-data augmentation
Wish I found
particularly interesting, focusing
on focuses on translating handwritten mathematical equations into latex, first insight into handwritten recognition techniques
The technical approach employs a modular architecture combining preprocessing classification and detection models Preprocessing is crucial
because we're taking pictures of pages
text direction varies and paper consistency differs
preprocessing stage includes photo normalization, which standardizes the image
and then classification identifies the chart type in this case distinguishing bar charts from other types
Now, detection models then extract specific elements This modular approach allows for tailored detection models for different chart types
rather than trying to handle all chart styles with a single extraction method
Eventually the system will integrate OCR for handwritten
text recognition, which will hand off to an element recognition function
information extraction functions to reconstruct charts
and tables accurately
The goal is to automate the extraction pipeline significantly reducing annual effort maintaining high accuracy
Indigitizing complex handwritten visual data
The data sources included
three main types first, camera capture images from my phone
or of handwritten barchards
Second, corresponding digital charts created using Python and
You'll be your note
and you're going to know books to see if the service ground truth And third,
Comma-separated value files
by containing tabulated data that I had synthesized using
Python and Jupiter
to give me the data sets
Have
Um
Four by hand written
and...
here
generated brochures
I synthesized the data using, sorry, I've already said that
- So
instead of going out and searching for a bunch of different
Barcher
and try to copy them and generate the data I ended up just automatically generating synthesized data
- I would
synthesize the comma-separated list
Then I would
converted into a...
computer barter with Python
Matt Fott-Lid, we're C-Worn And...
After that, I would
use the concept related list without
the computer generated image to
and draw these bar charts
The...
I thought it would be easier to scan them
because I wanted to skip the normalization steps
But when I saw the price of the Mobile Scanner
Now I decided to work on the higher steps instead So here you can see these are...
three sample images
of
at the bottom of the left-hand corner. These are three sample images of
Android and charts, and pictures taken in various annuals Some of them fuzzy, some of them off-angle on purpose I was some
I was...
doing these in order to stress tests
Um, then
paper normalization process. But because I had saved money on the scanner, I decided to buy gel pens
I went to Walmart and that was a very fortuitous trip
While in the stationary aisle with your pens, I stumbled upon five stars
latest paper
I was a skit
This I've already shown these
It's...
It's designed to be used with their study app and I was instantly fascinated by the features that make it this an effective medium for digitization
I spend a day modeling the paper and my own graphics program escape
that I've been using, and the most interesting features for me as a data scientist for the quick calibration squares in the corners of each page
And, um,
There were a few other features, but specifically those ones
So here is an example of the paper that I finished modeling
You can see that, um,
There are
these quick calibration squares
Each one of them is distinct from one another
And, um,
distinct within themselves
From a computer vision perspective, these four QC squares, each measuring roughly half a millimeter
The border is half a millimeter thick and each of the...
Squares is about a millimeter thick
in a that are arranged in a six by six pattern of black and white cells
And looking at them intuitively, I already knew
then uh
These were probably chosen for...
to avoid the axis of symmetry
Here you can see in this image that
the regular square has four axes of symmetry, meaning if you were to cut
The...
shape along that line and then fold it back over itself
you will see both sides of
of the axes of symmetry are the same
Um
And, if we go on to...
of it
the QC squares
Anyway, you cut them. They're just thing for themselves and I thought maybe it was a way to save some information and making five stars
only work with a certain paper or vice versa, but for our intents and purposes
You still?
The signature and across all the paper in the ring, it was the exact same
And I bought several rings so across all the--
Reams of paper
These were the four QC squares
So I took one apart and expanded it so you can see this is one that has been subdivided along
four regular axes of symmetry And you can see that top to bottom, left to right,
on the diagonals, none of the...
Axies of symmetry are...
along those regular axis axes
And the squares are not at least this one, you can go back
- Good
End
fact check me
for all four of them are distinct
So I labeled the front page as page one and the back page is page zero
Mainly because
I want to be...
But I wanted a title page to be
That would mean that every on page was page one and every
even as it was it was a
it was a trivial choice as an either scientist, but that's what it shows
So, page zero and page one
the top left, qualities
their quick calibration squares are the same
and you can see that they're featured in the
top left
Image
The top right
Sorry, page zero and page one share the same bottom right
And then page zero
and page one have
Different
right and bottom left
from each other, but within the page they're the same
So for each page you'll have
Three patterns
and...
one of those is to--
Thanks
per page
- It is
They're just every how they
of the quality squares semia
down a particular rabbit hole which I'll get to in a moment The other calibration feature that I thought was interesting was these triangles along the side
of the page usually on the spine
That
Bye
You don't even--
that I can guess if anything before it would be to calibrate the directional
H
The original paper was graph paper
You could have written
vertically or horizontally, depending on your notation of your notebook
And, um,
So I...
- Bye
I didn't really use these triangles, but I put them in my model
Anyways
because I wanted to use them at the later date if I ever needed
So...
Um...
And just on just a short note about these triangles, I measured them with a compass in the
The triangles are, I saw, slaves, and not equal at all
That means that there will always be a launch
Um
That helps in detecting the...
for orientation there is
I think...
that counted when there was like 43 of them per page
all arranged in the same column
But I got really...
worked out above this paper and as I was modeling
- Yeah, I ended up
having a few
moments to myself and so I ended up generating a
the graph paper which is the normal
paper And
blank paper just in case I needed it
dot matrix would be a good idea and then of course it's like war games
I did
And so I came up with my own paper for
and drawing workings in it
that line paper for my own creative writing
At the time of making this presentation, I didn't even--
- Yes
a musical staff paper for digitization of musical notes
which is not featured here, but...
It's probably one of the nerdiest things I've ever done
So evaluation techniques
[Music]
measurement of acts, uh,
For evaluation techniques, the page corner detection metric was designed to find accuracy for detection
- Corners, the metric uses
the product of area and salinity
And specifically,
Optimizing for the lowest value
I don't know if you can see the paper
with the different corners highlighted
For example, the top right corner was detected with a 72.2% accuracy
I wasn't particularly pleased with
Um...
(groans)
The rule-based detection, I ended up
using K nearest neighbors
the color and pattern detection and I hard coded
the Qc square patterns as 0s and 1s into the...
Python program
But in the future, I would like to make this a deep learning assisted function
'Cause
I think that's where deep learning will shine
However,
Generating images of tiny little QC squares that are...
(laughs)
I enjoy
five millimeters
Wide and ties
tedious so I didn't end up implementing that but I definitely plan to in the future
(mumbles)
(mumbles)
The problem with his rule base
And...
Detection is that
It breaks down if--
and the whole pipeline breaks down if
the program can detect
more than...
All right
any less if it can only detect
It has to detect four
When I was...
They're auto-grapping and auto-rotating with them
My program
And images were coming back, you know, the stress test images that I referenced earlier
It was coming back with three
corners and that was causing the
Croping to...
Slice and SKU
The paper in a way that the computer would...
No, no
What I want to do with
Uh...
Yeah, I think that...
As you can see, the areas are quite large in the corner detection
The deep learning would definitely help with the pattern detection
Timeline, it's a boy
So my original timeline
um was quite optimistic and I had planned to finish annotating and labeling the initial data set by week one
- Bye
completed that
I implemented normalization and although it's not as robust as I'd like, it works on the optimal
sample set
I plan to integrate baseline handwriting OCR and a chart classifier, but I did not get to the chart classification yet
at the time of this presentation, the subsequent weeks
We're intended for deploying element detectors and table recognizers checking for data parity with the CSV tables
integrating semantic assembly and running quantitative
However, now that the course is
- Over
I definitely intend
Continue this work
- I am now
Bob Haver
Um...
As you can see,
In this next one, I have updated the timeline to include
each image as its own and i don't know if you guys can see all of those lines but
Anyways
I separated each of the elements out into its own
timeline so that I can measure
roughly where it was in the
Thank you
from development to production I got the furthest along in page design
Let's see, let's
and computer vision functions are still...
I was still testing and developing, and then these antique functions, which I'll talk about later, were a new thing
They came out out of...
necessity and well
necessarily, necessarily, anyway
And then the sample synthesis was good
It was nonsensical data
fake datasets like
favorite genre of music for third year students
Or...
Things of the way I can
Maybe it would be helpful to have real world data
It would definitely be helpful
Yeah, for stress testing to have more than one
author for the handwritten
and then page cropping and rotating it, yeah, I got stuck in development
because the configuration functions were so
I'm still working on the calibration
I can normalize the --
on page 5
I will definitely continue working
work on
Ooh wait!
There's more!
We'll teach you my music theory and putting together a
for her
I was visited by my news, so I would like to present to you
They follow on
idea that I had after this
- Did I?
So do my name, pipeline
project. First
Using Python, I created a PDF maker that signs each page of a book
or PDF with a watermark so that it can be analyzed for tampering or cheating
The new features that I have added to the page
includes this barcode, which you can see at the very bottom of the page
which is an encoded UUID
Ah
and RGB
which is in the top left and if I move myself down
We're over
You can see that in the top right
is also Grayscale Calibration
taking images
with different color pens or pencils, etc
will be made easier in my opinion
by having these quick calibration
or at least calibration
Yeah
items and of course
I'll go on to talk about how the UID could be useful in that particular task
So some information can be stored in the barcode, like page orientation, answer areas, grades, etc This is, this is,
fully automatic part of
the data pipeline and
What it does is it takes a PDF and then...
Counts the pages
creates a EUID and then signs the page with
that UUID with barcodes so that when you are scanning the image in
and once it is calibrated
why it's cropped and scaled
can use the barcode to then detect things like
answer areas, or paper tape, et cetera, that I've listed above
if I were to expand this pipeline to include analysis, I could get
I can get a large language model to
process some of these answers once OCR is done and give feedback or do marking
And...
If this was used over the length of a semester with
handouts from students, it would be useful in
hand-drating forgery tests to make sure that people are writing
their exams in person
Here's an example of page two you can see that I've just got some questions and some answers that are overlaid
On top of the...
watermark
Another one
And fine
So
Hi, never thought
I would get so nerdy about paper, but it's a very exciting problem for me to tackle
I've got so many uses for it in my job where I'm not allowed to have
Bye
company data on the internet
to use artificial intelligence to help
Automate some of my workflow
It would be really useful to have
Things like...
Time sheets for
my notes for the day or to do lists
processed and then added to my knowledge base, so, you know, network drawings, etc The things that we do regularly for
for work
And so, um...
I mean, this has definitely been
A springboard for me, I will definitely
continue to work on this because
It continues to...
do back into the work that I do
