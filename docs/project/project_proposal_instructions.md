# Project Proposal Instructions

This assignment is the first step in a series of Peer Reviews designed to help you build your own data mining project. By submitting your proposal here, you'll receive valuable feedback from your peers on the viability and clarity of your idea. Reviewing others' work is also beneficial because it exposes you to different examples and inspires reflection to improve your project. Remember, peer feedback is a two-way street—your peers depend on your insights just as you depend on theirs. Please provide thoughtful scores and comments when reviewing submissions.

## Step 1: Select Your Idea

- Define a project idea that interests you and that you can continue working on throughout this course.
- You may reference ideas from previous week's discussion posts or draw from examples you've seen in class or real life.

> **Important Note:**  
> Treat your project as a valuable addition to your portfolio, demonstrating your skills as a data or computer scientist. Ensure your project is authentic and original. You’ll be better prepared to discuss your project in interviews or applications if the work is your own. This is your opportunity to showcase your abilities!

## Step 2: Crafting Your Project Proposal

- After selecting an idea, transform it into a formal project proposal.
- Earlier in this lesson, you learned about writing proposals and saw several examples. Now, you’ll write your own to explain and justify your idea.

## Final Thoughts

At this stage, you may not have every detail figured out. Your proposal should serve as a tentative plan and can evolve as you learn more. Use it as a guide for the rest of your project.

**Tip:**  
Draft your proposal and review it against the requirements before making your final submission.
