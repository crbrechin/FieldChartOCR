# Project Proposal Requirements (DTSA-5506)

## Core Deliverable
- Purpose: describe the planned data mining project; proposal is tentative and may change.
- Audience expects a concise, informative project title plus an optional memorable acronym.

## Required Sections
- **Abstract / Executive Summary**  
  - One to two paragraphs summarizing problem, approach, expected outputs, and anticipated value.
- **Introduction**  
  - Define the problem and why it matters.  
  - Explain prior attempts/solutions and highlight remaining gaps or limitations.  
  - Preview the potential contribution of your work.
- **Related Work**  
  - Group relevant literature, datasets, or tools into themes.  
  - Emphasize how your project leverages or improves on each group.
- **Proposed Work**  
  - Identify candidate datasets and available tools/services.  
  - Lay out prioritized tasks along the data mining pipeline: data understanding, preprocessing/management, modeling/analysis, and post-processing.  
  - Specify questions you plan to answer even if details remain open.
- **Evaluation Plan**  
  - Define effectiveness metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision/recall, support/confidence) tied to your objectives.  
  - Include efficiency considerations (runtime, throughput, latency).  
  - Outline the experimental setup: data splits, cross-validation, baselines, comparisons.
- **Timeline and Current Status**  
  - Map major tasks to calendar milestones; note what has already been accomplished (e.g., dataset acquisition, preliminary reading).
- **Risks, Challenges, and Alternatives**  
  - Anticipate potential roadblocks (data access, tooling limits) and list fallback strategies or alternative questions.
- **Conclusion & Future Work**  
  - Summarize the proposal and restate expected contributions.  
  - Suggest potential follow-on investigations beyond the initial scope.

## General Guidance
- It is acceptable—and expected—to refine the plan later; proposal should demonstrate clear analytical reasoning today.
- Use concise, informative language; avoid filler.
- Reference existing solutions to show awareness and context.
- Highlight how evaluation results will be interpreted by stakeholders.
- Maintain professional formatting and section headers for easy navigation.
